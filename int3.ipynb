    "As shown by the R2 values for the three types of data preprocessing (and mean r2 values when running cross validation), none have had a significant impact on the efficiency of the model.

For instance, if one features scale is much larger than anothers, then the coefficient for that feature may also be larger in comparison to other features with smaller scales. Standardizing prevents this as all features are on the same scale. For example, it has shown that A, B and C all affect the value for D equally. We can prove this by plotting the original data vs the scaled data which is shown below. \n",

    "The use of regularisation has been implemented by using RidgeCV regression. The data was first pre-processed by standardising it - removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This is important as if features have different scales, then the penalty term will have a different effect on the coefficients of the features, depending on their scale. This can mean that the model may give more weight to features with larger scales, potentially ignoring smaller ones.\n",

As shown previously, we can see that the 3 features (A, B & C) are direct translations of each other. Its generally not a good idea to use highly correlated features in any type of regularized linear regression. The penalty term is not likely to be able to effectively determine any unimportant features as once scaled these features are identical (shown by the coefficients of A, B & C being identical). This therefore means that the addition of the penalty term had no additional effect.\n"
