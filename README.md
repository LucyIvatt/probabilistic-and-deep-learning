This repository contains various examples of probabilisic and deap learning within the notebook `int3.ipynb`.

## Regression and classification
Example of least squares linear regression model predicting the value of a variable from three others. Also includes examples of data normalising, scaling, regularisation and their effects on the outcome. 

## Principal Component Analysis 
Performs an example of principal component analysis

## Hand drawn tree symbol classification
Creates a classification model for hand-drawn trees from an unbalanced dataset - used Weighted Random Sampling to prevent bias.

`3363 / 3366 predictions correct with 99.91% accuracy`

## Generating tree symbol images of a specific class
CGAN to generate the hand-drawn tree diagrams. Unfortunately suffered from mode collapse.

### 4 random images of each tree class:
